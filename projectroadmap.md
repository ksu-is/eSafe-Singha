Project Road Map
Sprint 1
Related Python Code: https://github.com/ksu-is/Safe-Keeping/blob/main/safe-keeping.py
1. "Find related repository and evaluate it"
*I have read and ran the code myself. I found that this exsisting code's intention is for password storage that is secure and accessible. 
I think this is a good basecode to use for my project, 
which is to create a code for personal information/documents, but have it protected/secure and accessible to the user*

Sprint 2
#Created eSafe.py to show that I created a code file.
#Commit 1: updated method and variable naming to reflect personal information instead of just passwords.
#Commit 2: Added persistent login state with current_user variable and conditional control flow for login/logout states.
